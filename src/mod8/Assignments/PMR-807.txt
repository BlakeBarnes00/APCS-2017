	**************************** P M R ************************************************
	    This program showed me how to properly create and use multiple objects at once
	    and then I printed out the data from them using 'printf()'.
	***********************************************************************************
	    I will use classes and objects to prevent me from having to repeat code over
	    again and make my programming more enjoyable and functional.
