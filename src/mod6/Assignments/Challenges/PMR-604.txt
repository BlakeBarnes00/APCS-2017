	**************************** P M R ************************************************
	    This lesson I showed that I know how to format strings and use arrays by
	    sorting out data into different arrays, then looping through them using
	    the for-each loop.
	***********************************************************************************
	    I will keep using for-each loops to loop through arrays of specific types.
