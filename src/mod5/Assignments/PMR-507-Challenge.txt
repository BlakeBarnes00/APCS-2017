	**************************** P M R ************************************************
		This program was a challenge that made me have to think outside of the box
		on how to randomly generate things from an ASCII table. With this I used
		functions that would help me break the program down into more managable 
		and reusable code so that I didn't have to rewrite numerous lines of code.
		I also used different ways of handling the generation and avoiding 
		unwanted characters from slipping into the passwords.
	***********************************************************************************
		I find the use of functions and other ways of managing this code to be very
		useful, I will continue to use select practices from here in future 
		programs.
